# Brahmagupta and Arithmetic

## Introduction

This science of *dhūlikarma* has not been imparted by great teachers for blasphemy. One who would be using it for this purpose would lose all good name.¹

Brahmagupta uses the term *gaṇita* only for those calculations which are of an arithmetical nature. The science of algebra, the foundations of which were laid by Āryabhaṭa I, was named as *kuṭṭaka* or *kuṭṭākāra* by Āryabhaṭa, and in the *Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta* also it is separately dealt with under *Kuṭṭādhyāya* or *kuṭṭakādhyāya* (Chapter XVIII). Later on, the term *bījagaṇita* was specifically given to the science of algebra.

The *Kuṭṭādhyāya* of the *Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta* deals with the:
1. Concept of *kuṭṭaka* (pulveriser),
2. Addition of positive and negative as well as zero quantities,
3. Equations in one unknown (*eka-varṇa samīkaraṇa*),
4. Equations in several unknowns (*aneka-varṇa samīkaraṇa*),
5. Equations involving products of unknowns (*bhavita*),
6. Quadratic equations (*varga-prakṛtiḥ*) (Chapter XVIII of the *Brahmasphuṭa-siddhānta*).

## Āryabhaṭa, Bhāskara, and Brahmagupta Use Place Value Notations

In Europe, the first definite traces of the place-value numerals are found in the tenth and eleventh centuries, but the numerals came into general use in mathematical textbooks only in the seventeenth century. In India, however, Āryabhaṭa I (499), Bhāskara I (522), Lalla (c. 598), and Brahmagupta (628) all use the place-value numerals. There is no trace of any other system in their works. Perhaps in this country, we had the place-value system as early as 200 B.C. if not earlier. The use of a symbol for zero is found in Pīṅgala's *Chandaḥ Sūtra* (perhaps of 200 B.C.). In literature, we have an indication of the place value from about 100 B.C. and later in the Purāṇas from the second to the fourth century A.D. The *Bakhshālī Manuscript* (perhaps of 200 A.D.) uses the place-value notations.

The earliest use of the place-value principle with the letter numerals is found in the works of Bhāskara I about the beginning of the sixth century A.D. Thus, for 3179, the expressive words are *Navādriyupāgni* (nava 9, adri 7, rupa 1, and agni 3). Similarly, in the *Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta*, for a large number like 2296828522, the expressive terms are *Dviyama-sarāṣṭa-pakṣa-vasu-rasa-nava-dviyamāh* (Dviyama two twos 22, Sara 5, asta 8, pakṣa 2, vastu 8, rasa 6, nava 9, dviyamāh 22).² Such usages are to be found in all works, which clearly state that the place-value concept was popular as a routine.

From India, this system reached Arabia. During the reign of the Khalif Al-Mansur (753-774 A.D.), there came embassies from Sindh to Baghdad, and among them were scholars who brought along with them several works on mathematics, including the *Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta* and the *Khaṇḍa-khādyaka* of Brahmagupta. With the help of these scholars, Alfazari, perhaps also Yakub ibn Tarik, translated them into Arabic. Both works were largely used and exercised great influence on Arab mathematics. It was on that occasion that the Arabs first became acquainted with a scientific system of astronomy. It is acceptable to all writers on the subject that it was at that time that the Hindu numerals were first definitely introduced amongst the Arabs. Arabs at first adopted the *ghubār* form of numerals which they had already obtained (but without zero) from the Alexandrians or from the Syrians. This they continued for about two centuries, but since they were not suited to their right-to-left script, they gave them up and adopted the more convenient ones. For a detailed discussion on how numerals went to the west from India and spread in Europe, one is referred to the discussion in the *History of Hindu Mathematics, Part I* by Datta and Singh (1935, Single volume Edition, 1962, pp. 83-104). It is remarkable that Brahmagupta's works like the *Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta* and the *Khaṇḍa-khādyaka* became instrumental in the spread of the place-value notation in the neighboring countries of the Middle East, and from there, this system spread into Europe.

## Operations and Determinations in Pāṭīgaṇita

The word *Pāṭīgaṇita* is a compound formed from the words *pāṭa*, meaning 'board', and *gaṇita*, meaning 'science of calculation', hence it means the science of calculation which requires the use of writing material (the board). The word *pāṭa* is not Sanskrit (it originated in the non-Sanskrit literature in India); the oldest term in Sanskrit for the board is *phalaka* or *paṭṭa*. However, this term got currency in the Sanskrit literature also about the beginning of the seventh century. Brahmagupta does not use the term *pāṭīgaṇita*: he favors the use of the term *dhūlikarma* or writing figures on dust spread on a board or on the ground. The word *pāṭīgaṇita* was translated into Arabic as *ʿilm al-ḥisāb al-takhtī* (calculation on board) and the word *dhūlikarma* as *ḥisāb al-ghubār* (calculation on dust).

Brahmagupta, in the very first verse in Chapter XII (*Gaṇitādhyāya*), refers to twenty operations (*parikarma*) and eight determinations:

> He who distinctly and severally knows the twenty logistics, addition etc., and the eight determinations (*vyavahāra*) including (measurement by) shadow is a *gaṇaka* (mathematician).³

The commentators have given the list of these logistics (*parikarma*) and determinations (*vyavahāra*) as follows:

### (A) Parikarma or Logistics
1. **Saṅkalitam** (addition)
2. **Vyavakalitam** (subtraction)
3. **Ghaṇanam** (multiplication)
4. **Bhāgahāraḥ** (division)
5. **Vargaḥ** (square)
6. **Vargamūlam** (square-root)
7. **Ghaṇaḥ** (cube)
8. **Ghaṇamūlam** (cube root)
9. **Pañca-jāti** (five standard forms of fractions)
10. **Trairāśikam** (the rule of three)
11. **Vyaṣṭa-trairāśikam** (the inverse rule of three)
12. **Pañca-rāśikam** (the rule of five)
13. **Sapta-rāśikam** (the rule of seven)
14. **Nava-rāśikam** (the rule of nine)
15. **Ekādaśa-rāśikam** (the rule of eleven)
16. **Bhāṇḍa-pratibhāṇḍam** (barter and exchange)

### (B) Vyavahāra or Determinations
1. **Mīśrakaḥ** (mixture)
2. **Śreḍhī** (progression or series)
3. **Kṣetram** (plane figures)
4. **Khātam** (excavation)
5. **Citiḥ** (stock)
6. **Krākacikaḥ** (saw)
7. **Rāśiḥ** (mound)
8. **Chāyā** (shadow)

Of the operations enlisted here, the first eight have been considered fundamental by later writers as Mahāvīra. The operations of duplation and mediation (doubling and halving) were considered fundamental by Arabs, Greeks, and Egyptians; since they were not familiar with the place-value system.

Mathematics in this country developed as an aid to astronomy, and therefore, for the first time, we find Āryabhaṭa (499 A.D.) in his *Āryabhaṭīya* describing as a special section (*Gaṇitapāda*). Brahmagupta (628 A.D.) also followed Āryabhaṭa in this respect and gave the science of calculation (*gaṇita*) a special place in his treatise on astronomy. The *Siddhānta* treatises, earlier than those of Āryabhaṭa and Brahmagupta, do not contain a chapter exclusively devoted to *gaṇita* (the *Sūrya-Siddhānta* and the Siddhāntas of *Vasiṣṭha*, *Pitāmaha*, and *Romaka* are thus without *gaṇita* chapters). Later on, Bhāskara I and Lalla also did not include *gaṇita* as a section or chapter in their treatises. It is said, however, that Lalla wrote a separate treatise on *Pāṭīgaṇita*.

It may further be remarked here that Āryabhaṭa I gives the rules for finding the square and cube roots only, whilst Brahmagupta gives the cube-root rule only (*BrSpSī*. XII. 7).

## Multiplication

Undoubtedly, the common Indian name for 'multiplication' is *guṇana*. This term occurs in the Vedic literature also. The other terms for this logistics are *hanana*, *vāha*, *kṣaya*, etc., which all mean 'killing' or 'destroying.' The synonyms of *hanana* (killing) for multiplication have been used by Āryabhaṭa I (499), Brahmagupta (628), Śrīdhara (c. 750), and later writers, and these terms also occur in the *Bakhshālī Manuscript*.

Āryabhaṭa I does not mention the everyday methods of multiplication in his *Āryabhaṭīya*, probably because they were too elementary to be included in a *Siddhānta* work. Brahmagupta, however, in a supplement to the section on mathematics in his *Siddhānta*, gives the names of some methods with very brief descriptions of the processes:

> The multiplicand repeated, as in *gomūtrikā*, as often as there are digits in the multiplier, is severally multiplied by them and (the results) added according to places; this gives the product. Or the multiplicand is repeated as many times as there are component parts in the multiplier.⁴

(The word *bheda* occurring in the verse has been translated as "integrant portions" by Colebrooke, p. 319. Again, by the term *bheda* are meant portions which, added together, make the whole, or aliquot parts which, multiplied together, make the entire quantity.)

> The multiplicand is multiplied by the sum or the difference of the multiplier and an assumed quantity and, from the result, the product of the assumed quantity and the multiplicand is subtracted or added.⁵

(Colebrooke thinks that this is a method to obtain the true product when the multiplier has been taken to be too great or too small by mistake.⁶ Datta and Singh think, however, that this is not correct.⁷)

Thus, Brahmagupta mentions four methods of multiplication:
1. **Gomūtrikā**,
2. **Khaṇḍa**,
3. **Bheda**, and
4. **Iṣṭa**.

The common and well-known method of *kaṇṭha-sandhi* has been omitted by him.

### (i) Gomūtrikā-method or Zig-Zag Method

The word *gomūtrikā* means "similar to the course of cow's urine," hence "zigzag." This method, in all essentials, is the same as the *śūnyaṅga* method. The following illustration is based on the commentary of Pṛthūdaka Svāmi:

**Example:** To multiply 1223 by 235.

The numbers are written thus:

-----

The first line of figures is then multiplied by 2, the process beginning at the units place, thus: \(2 \times 3 = 6\); 3 is rubbed out and 6 substituted in its place, and so on. After all the horizontal lines have been multiplied by the corresponding numbers on the left in the vertical line, the numbers on the *pāṭī* stand thus:

----

after being added together as in the present method.

The *śūnyaṅga* and the *gomūtrikā* methods resemble the modern plan of multiplication most closely.

### (ii) Khaṇḍa Method or Parts Multiplication Method

Since the days of Brahmagupta, this method of multiplication also became very popular. We have two methods under this head:

1. **The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it.** The multiplicand is then multiplied severally by these, and the results are added.

   **Example:**
   \[
   13 \times 158 = (6 + 7) \times 158 = (6 \times 158) + (7 \times 158) = 948 + 1106 = 2054
   \]

2. **The multiplier is broken up into two parts.** The multiplicand is then multiplied by one of these, the resulting product by the second, and so on till all the parts are exhausted. The ultimate product is the result.

## Square

The Sanskrit term for square is *varga* or *kṛti* (*varga* literally means "rows" or "troops" of similar things). In mathematics, it usually means the square power and also the square figure or its area. Thus, we find in the *Āryabhaṭīya*:

> A square figure of four equal sides (and the number representing its area) are called *varga*. The product of the two equal quantities is also *varga*.⁸

The term *kṛti* means "doing," "making," or "action." It carries with it the idea of specific performance, probably the graphical representation.

For the first time, we have a definite rule for squaring in the writings of Brahmagupta. But it does not mean that prior to him, it was not known. It must have been known to Āryabhaṭa I since he has given the square-root method.

Brahmagupta gives his method of squaring briefly as follows:

> Combining the product, twice the digit in the less (lowest) place into the several others (digits) with its (i.e., of the digit in the lowest place) square (repeatedly) gives the square.⁹

The method has been more clearly enunciated by Mahāvīra (850 A.D.) in the *Gaṇitasārasaṅgraha*:

> Having squared the last (digit), multiply the rest by the digits by twice the last, (which) is moved forward (by one place). Then moving the remaining digits, continue the same operation (process). This gives the square.¹⁰

Brahmagupta's method of squaring is shown by the following example:

**Example:** To square 125.

The number is written down:

----

The square of the digit in the last place, i.e., \(5^2 = 25\), is set over it thus:

---

Then, \(2 \times 5 = 10\) is placed below the other digits, and 5 is rubbed out, thus:

----

Multiplying by 10 the rest of the digits, i.e., 12, and setting the product over them (the digits), we have:

----


Then, rubbing out 10, which is not required, and moving the rest of the digits, i.e., 12, we have:

----

Thus, one round of operations is completed.

Again, as before, setting the square of 2 above it and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) below 1, we have:

----

Multiplying the remaining digit 1 by 4 and setting the product above it, we have:

----

Then, moving the remaining digit 1, we obtain:

----

Thus, the second round of operations is completed.

Next, setting the square of 1 above it, the process is completed, for there are no remaining figures, and the result stands thus:

---

### Algebraic Method of Squaring

Brahmagupta, in his *Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta*, gives a minor method of squaring thus:

> The product of the sum and the difference of the number (to be squared) and an assumed number plus the square of the assumed number gives the square.¹¹

This may be represented by the following identity:
\[
n^2 = (n - a)(n + a) + a^2
\]

This identity has been used for squaring by most of the Indian mathematicians. Thus:
\[
15^2 = (15 - 5)(15 + 5) + 5^2 = 225
\]

We are not giving here other identities which have been used by later mathematicians of India in getting the squares of numbers; for example, when Mahāvīra says:

> The sum of the squares of the two or more portions of the number together with their products each with the others multiplied by two gives the square.¹
