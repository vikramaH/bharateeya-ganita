Description

Science is a passion for facts and a constant and systematic search for truth. It flourishes in an atmosphere of freedom. Such an atmosphere used to exist in ancient India where the passion for truth seeking could find expression and sustenance. The people of ancient India made immense contributions in the fields of philosophy, religion, pure sciences and technology. This is the reason why India is considered as one of the hot beds of human civilization which has made enormous contribution to enrich the intellectual heritage of mankind. At the end of the first millennium India was at the pinnacle of its glory, when the so called “New World” was not yet discovered and the birth country of Industrial Revolution was not yet well known to the world.

The encyclopedia is the outcome of the sustained work put in for several years by the well known author Shri M.S. Sreedharan in collecting, collating and writing up the information and prevailing ancient sciences in the form of a thesaurus. This work is a glowing tribute to the erudite scholarship of the author, who is not amidst us any more. This book will be a great guide and source of inspiration for the readers, specially the youth of India.
